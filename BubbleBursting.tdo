\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{red!40}{\leavevmode {\color {red!40}o}}\ \textbf {Here is the catch:} Reviewer 3 asked us to mention these values. In principle, that is fine. However, in practice, it is not one size that fits all. These are the most common threshold values. But, I change these values depending on $\mathcal {O}h$ and $\mathcal {J}$. For example, for low $\mathcal {O}h$ and $\mathcal {J}$, velocity and vorticity tolerances of $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-3}$, respectively are sufficient, but for higher values of $\mathcal {O}h$ and $\mathcal {J}$, I need smaller tolerances, like $\mathcal {O}h = 1.0$ and $\mathcal {J} = 1.0$ was run with velocity and vorticity tolerances of $10^{-3}$ and $5 \times 10^{-4}$ respectively. The decision depends on how well the grid resolution is inside the yielded region. Moreover, tiny tolerances will give rise to crazily expensive simulations. What value to choose exactly comes from experience and can vary from simulation to simulations, sometimes between two-time instances in the same simulation. Of course, when the latter happens, for some cases, I verify it with multiple values of these tolerances to see that everything is fine. Anyone using Basilisk would know that these tolerances are not set in stone. How much do you think we should elaborate on this? It is one of those things that no one really talks about in much detail (e.g. \href {https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.5.033605}{here}). I guess the values that I have mentioned should work for most of the cases presented in the paper -- those are also the values that I mention in the codes I have published on the Basilisk website and \citet {basiliskVatsal}.}{5}{section*.3}%

It flows with a very high viscosity but we chose (incidentally) $\mathcal {O}h_{\text {max}}$ such that it is only reached far away from the cavity when $\|\boldsymbol {\mathcal {D}}\|$ is really zero.}{22}{section*.7}%
